# Terraform-project
Created three(3) ec2 instances with each displaying it ip address and also time and date in Lagos,Nigeria.
The three ec2 instances are  connected to an application load balancer to serve as a single point of contact to distribute incoming trafics across the three instances.
And also Hosted a domain name in Route53.
i did all this using terraform
